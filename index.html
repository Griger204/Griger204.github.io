    <h1 id="p1">A little about me</h1>
      <p class="wordsAll">My name is Gal Riger and I'm in grade 11 at AY Jackson currently taking the ICS4U course.
         I took computer science all throughout highschool in hopes to making a future out of it.
          The concept of computer science really interests me because of all the amazing and creative concepts you can make just through code and learning!
           For example, I've made this portfolio to show off all the cool projects I've done throughout this class.
            I learned many things such as basic knowledge about computers and how they work, to codeing with html, css, and Javascript, 
            which I used to make this website and all that's in it. I'm hoping to keep learning and improve my abilities as a computer programmer
             and hopefully inspire other to do the same. <br><br>
        A little more about me however, I love playing video games every chance I get as well as play piano in my free time.
         Some of my favorite foods include Sushi, Spaghetti, and I would never turn down a slice of pizza.
          My favorite color is green of course, and I enjoy listening to Hip Hop & rap as well as watch comedy movies.
 <br><br>
        Enjoy my website!
