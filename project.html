        <h1 id="p1">Refactored Projects</h1>
          <p class="wordsAll">Here you will find two projects inspired from Dan Shiffman that I slightly refactored to add something new to them.
              These changes are small but they get me to interact with the projects in a way where I can learn different ways my
              own visions and coding can be applied to different things.
                   <br><br>
            The projects I worked on are called <strong>Black Hole</strong>, and <strong>Flappy Bird</strong>.

        <p class="wordsAll"><strong>The refactored versions of:</strong></p>
        <p class="explain">These projects/challenges are taken from Dan Shiffmans "Coding Train" and were presented in the ICS4U class</p>

            <p class="prompt">This challenge simulates the functions of a black hole. In this particular program, a spaceship is being pulled in by the strong force of gravity,
                changing it's path and direction. As the original program included light rays being simulated, I refactored the project by removing most light rays,
                only leaving one to act as the path. I also added a .png image of a spaceship and had the path change colors to make things more interesting.
                The final thing I refactored was changing the background so it really does look like space.

            <p class="prompt">This challenge is a little less detailed replica of the game "Flappy Bird". The object of the game is to get as furthest as possible
                without hitting any pipe (although you get a couple tries here). The original challenge by Dan Shiffman included a "self-playing" ball dodging the pipes
                as they come towards it. The refactored virsion includes the 'space' key as the jumping function as well as a timer and score.
                I also changed the speed of the pipes every 5 seconds and replaced the ball with an actual bird.

        <p class="prompt" id="refpromt">I learned a lot by working on both these challenges because they both have their differences and similarities.
            I had to get to know the code and understand it before I could refactor and work on it. Therefore, problem solving was a big part of working
            through this challenge. What helped me was to find connections between other projects I've done and used in the past. It gets easier to do new and
            more challenging things if you find similarities within, and use your past knowledge and experiences which is what I'll contiue doing.
