      <h1 id="p2">Top 10 Modules</h1>
      <p class="wordsAll">These are the 10 modules I've completed and chose to include in my portfolio. My modules include: 
        <strong>4 modules from computer programming, 4 modules from computer principles, and 2 modules from freecodecamp.</strong> Keep in mind, 
        there were multiple projects for each module in khan academy, but I've only listed one from each.</p>
      
      <h1 class="mods"><strong>Khan Academy - Intro to JS</strong></h1>
      <script class="khan" src="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/portfolio-build-a-house/4742468437753856/embed.js?editor=yes&buttons=yes&author=yes&embed=yes"></script>
      <p class="explain">Learn how to use the JavaScript language and the ProcessingJS library to create fun drawings and animations.
      </p>
      <p class="prompt">This course showed me the ability of code and there is no limit to how creative you want to get.
         Khan Academy introduced many new concepts to me that are very useful and proved how drawing and animation could be used for countless things. 
         This lesson taught me the ways I can have fun with code and allowed me to express my thoughts through creative code/art.
      </p>
      
      <h1 class="mods"><strong>Khan Academy - Intro to HTML/CSS</strong></h1>
      <script class="khan" src="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/portfolio-project-blog/5597379916414976/embed.js?editor=yes&buttons=yes&author=yes&embed=yes"></script>
      <p class="explain">Learn how to use HTML and CSS to make webpages. HTML is the markup language that you surround content with, 
        to tell browsers about headings, lists, tables, etc. CSS is the stylesheet language that you style the page with, to tell browsers to change the
         color, font, layout, and more.      
        </p>
      <p class="prompt">This course allowed me to experience the basics of creating a webpage. I learned things such as format, as well as customization. 
        Just like the previous module, creativity is what drove me through this lesson. Applying all that I've learned here, 
        I was able to create the website you see this on. I will always look for room to improve and make stuff better.
      </p>
      
      <h1 class="mods"><strong>Khan Academy - Games and Visualizations</strong></h1>
      <script class="khan" src="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/portfolio-project-memory/4914562324709376/embed.js?editor=yes&buttons=yes&author=yes&embed=yes"></script>
     <p class="explain">Once you've taken Intro to JS, go here to learn techniques to help you make multi-scene programs, 3d graphics, button menus, and scored games.</p>
     <p class="prompt">This course is a prolongation of intro to JS. The only difference is here, I put my practice into actual working games. 
       This class has tought me all about creating visual aspects and that there is not just a set of things you can do with JS, 
       there are infinte possibilities to move forward and refactor (for anything truly) through machine learning.
     </p>
      
      <h1 class="mods"><strong>Khan Academy - Natural Simulations</strong></h1>
      <script class="khan" src="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/portfolio-project-creature-colonies/6563745880293376/embed.js?editor=yes&buttons=yes&author=yes&embed=yes"></script>
      <p class="explain">Once you've taken Intro to JS, go here to learn techniques to help you make multi-scene programs, 3d graphics, button menus, and scored games.</p>
      <p class="prompt">Using all the principles learned before this with JS, 
        I applied a bunch of physics concepts to create different kinds of vector movements to simulate the real world. 
        This was the hardest module out of all but it's fascinating to apply the laws of physics into a computer simulation. 
        This allows visualisations with JS to be almost truly realistic and I learned that I can use different techniques that combine to make some crazy outputs. 
      </p>
      
      <h1 class="mods"><strong>Khan Academy - AP®︎/College Computer Science Principles</strong></h1>
      <p class="wordsAll">This course includes 800+ practice questions, plus instructional articles and 
       videos covering the topics of digital information, the Internet, cybersecurity, programming, algorithms, simulations, and data analysis. 
        These combine for a total of 4 modules.</p>

      <p class="subWordsAll"><strong>Digital Information</strong><br>This unit explains how computers store information digitally, as binary data. 
        Teaches about the binary number system, the conversion of analog to digital data, and data compression strategies.</p>
      
      <p class="subWordsAll"><strong>The Internet</strong><br>This unit covers how the Internet works. 
        Teaches about the physical layer (Ethernet, Fiber, WiFi), the protocols (IP, TCP, UDP, DNS, HTTP), the World Wide Web, and the digital divide.</p>
      
      <p class="subWordsAll"><strong>Programming</strong><br>This unit introduces fundamental programming concepts. 
        Teaches about variables, strings, procedures, Boolean logic, randomness, repetition, and lists, with examples in JavaScript, Snap, Python.</p>
      
      <p class="subWordsAll"><strong>Algorithms</strong><br>This unit gives an overview of algorithms: 
        expressing algorithms in flow chart and pseudocode, testing their correctness, and measuring their efficiency. 
        I also explored heuristics-based approaches for problems that can’t be solved in a reasonable amount of time, 
        introduce the existence of undecidable problems, and explain the computational methods of parallel and distributed computing.</p>
      
      <p class="subWordsAll"><strong>Data analysis</strong><br>The unit introduces data analysis and the world of big data. 
        Teaches about storing data sets in files, spreadsheets, and databases, computing statistics like average and maximum, 
        finding patterns like trends and correlations. Learn how big data can be used to improve algorithms like translation, image recognition, and recommendations.</p>
      
      <p class="subWordsAll"><strong>Simulations</strong><br> This unit explores simulations, with interactive examples from various fields. 
        Teaches how to use random numbers and walk-through the process of creating a simple simulation.</p>
      
      <p class="subWordsAll"><strong>Online Date Security</strong><br> This unit introduces the concept of PII and the ways in which PII and other data 
        can be tracked online (cookies, search history, browsing history, geolocation). Teaches how attackers can gain access to 
        data and devices with phishing, rogue access points, and malware, and see how you can protect yourself with 
        encryption, secure protocols, strong passwords, and multifactor authentication.</p>
      
      <p class="subWordsAll"><strong>Computing innovations</strong><br> This unit explores a wide range of computing innovations that are possible now 
        due to computers and the Internet, and considers the benefits and risks of each innovation. Teaches about social media, citizen science, smart sensors, and more.</p>
      
      <p class="prompt" id="APprompt"> This course has tought me that there is so much more to computer science than just code. Computer science is a whole stream of connections
        between the code and how that code is gathered, processed, distributed and used. Computer's and the internet all around the world work in a system
        that allows information to flow through it safely, efficiently, and correctly. There are so many dependant variables on how information flows through us over
        digitally that it's important to understand how these stuff work so we could only make it better. All these topics here impact our day-today lives,
        so I will continue to further understand these topics and algorithms for better sense of what happens when I press "run" or share my code with others or even the world.

  data-pen-title="MyProject">
    <p class="explain">HTML and CSS practice project</p>
      <p class="prompt">Free Code Camp is very similar too Khan Academy. 
        I was able to use my knowledge from there to complete both my FCC projects as well as this website. 
        This course also taught me the best uses from HTML and CSS and helped me improve my ability to use the precisely and most efficiently principles
        when it comes to building a web page from sccratch (which I am). After completing some of the lessons, 
        I have been more capable of things from using code, to organizing what I do with it.</p>
  
  <h1 class="mods"><strong>FreeCodeCamp - Survey Form</strong></h1>
      <p class="codepen" data-height="565" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="galtopia" data-slug-hash="JjRqNRX" 
      style="height: 500px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" 
      data-pen-title="FCC: Survey Form">
       <p class="explain">HTML and CSS practice project #2</p>
      <p class="prompt">This project from FCC, just like the other, included "user stories" that I had to complete in order to get full points on the projects. 
        Getting these tasks done required lots or trial and error as well as problem solving using new concepts of HTML and CSS. 
        The CSS lesson as well as this project that went with it taught me the connections between html and css and how customizable a website can get. 
        After completing this, I was interested on how much further I could go with CSS and what sorts of new concepts I could use for future projects (like this website)</p>
